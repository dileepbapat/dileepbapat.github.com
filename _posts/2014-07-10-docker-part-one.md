Creating minimal docker image
-----------------------------



what you need :

-   docker installed on linux variant (tested on Ubuntu 14LTS)

-   gcc for making minimal application



docker can import archives such as tar, tar.gz, .bzip etc. you can package all
necessary files into an archive and import it into docker.



`tar cv --files-from /dev/null \| sudo docker import - empty`

This will create empty image in docker repository.



Now lets create Helloworld application to package it to docker.

file: a.c

	#include<stdio.h>

	void main() { 

	  printf("Hello from docker!!\n");  

	}



We can compile with static linking to avoid shared library dependencies.

	gcc -static a.c -o a`

Verify that there are not dependencies with ldd

	ldd "a"
	>     not a dynamic executable



Create a Dockerfile with below entries (configuration for docker container that
we are about to build).

	FROM empty 
	ADD ./a /a 
	CMD ["/a"]



It says docker that seed the image from empty image that we have created and add
file a

to it as target path /a and startup command is to execute /a



Now build the image with

	$ sudo docker build -t "first_image" ./
	Sending build context to Docker daemon 880.6 kB 
	Sending build context to Docker daemon 
	Step 0 : FROM empty 
	 ---> 62f67e5fbc6a 
	Step 1 : ADD ./a /a 
	 ---> 1236c4ce0129 
	Step 2 : CMD ["/a"] 
	 ---> f6982bf61e13 
	Successfully built f6982bf61e13


Now you can list images with

	$sudo docker images
	REPOSITORY   TAG    IMAGE ID     CREATED           VIRTUAL SIZE 
	first_image  latest 9ba228119b81 54 seconds ago      877.4 kB
	


To Run the docker instance in background mode :

	$ sudo docker run first_image 



You should see output like

	Hello from docker




{% include JB/setup %}
